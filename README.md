# Description

SuperCLEVR-Physics is a dynamical scene understanding dataset for video question answering. The objects are annotated with (1) static properties (**shape**, **color**) and (2) 3D dynamical properties (**3D position**, **velocities**, **external forces**), and (3) physical properties (**mass**, **frictions**, **restitution**).

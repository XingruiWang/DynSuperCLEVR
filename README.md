A dynamical 3D scene understanding dataset for Video Question Answering. The scenes are annotated with objects' (1) static properties (**shape**, **color**) and (2) 3D dynamical properties (**3D position**, **velocities**, **external forces**), and (3) physical properties (**mass**, **frictions**, **restitution**); and Collision Event (objects involved, frame).
